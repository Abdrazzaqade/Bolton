**INTRODUCTION**
This project used R to explore machine learning models using Weather Forecasting Dataset. The dataset for this project is from the Weather Research and Forecasting Model for May 2018 
from areas in the United Kingdom. 

**PROBLEM STATEMENT**

The agricultural industry in the United Kingdom contributes significantly to the huge supply of food 
in the country, the manufacturing industries, and the economy. Conversely, climate change, 
market dynamics, and changes in regulations are among the various difficulties farmers in the 
country encounter, threatening the industry's long-term sustainability. One of the most significant 
challenges faced by farmers in the UK is how unpredictable the weather can be. The United 
Kingdom has a temperate maritime climate with mild temperatures and high rainfall all year. 
However, due to climate change, extreme weather events such as droughts, heatwaves, and 
floods in recent years have steadily been on the increase in recent years. Farmers who are already 
used to predictable weather patterns for crop and livestock management have faced significant 
challenges because of these weather patterns. 
Soil moisture and nutrient levels have seen a significant decline due to frequent droughts; this can 
harm crop growth and yield. Heavy rainfall also affects crop quality, from causing waterlogged 
fields, making it difficult to plant and harvest crops and lowering crop quality. Extreme weather 
events, such as floods and heatwaves, can cause stress and illness in livestock, leading to low 
productivity and, in some cases, death of livestock. To mitigate the effects of extreme weather 
events, farmers may need to invest in costly irrigation systems, water storage facilities, or drainage 
systems. These additional expenses will increase the already high cost of farming while straining
the already low profit margins.

**OBJECTIVES**

The major objective of this project is to build a machine learning model useful to farmers in the 
United Kingdom which will aid decision making on optimal planting periods and planning farm 
operations.
